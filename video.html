<p>The axolotl is found more in research labs than anywhere else. They are famous for regenerating their limbs back. The axolotl will regenerate the limbs such as their arms and legs, but they can also regenerate the front portion of their brain called the telencephalon. If you crush their spinal cord or sever their spinal cord it will regenerate in about 3 weeks and the tail and legs will work again. Axolotls are also able regenerate around a third of their heart and regrow their heart in about 30-60 days. The reason the axolotl can regenerate differently from humans is because when humans have a limb cut off, a human body will react by closing up the wound with skin tissue. Axolotls will transform nearby cells into stem cells and form bones, skin, and veins into their exact original state.</p>

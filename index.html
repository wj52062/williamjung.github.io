<p>The name axolotl translates to "water monster" in ancient Aztec tongue. The axolotl is found exclusively in Lake Xochimilco near Mexico City. Axolotls tend to live exclusively in the water their whole life. However, there are rare occasions where an axolotl will mature and surface from the water. Axolotls can reach up to a foot in length and they are usually black or mottled brown, but albino axolotls are common as well. An axolotl's life span will live up to 15 years in age, and they have a carnivorous diet consisting of mollusks, worms, insect larvae, crustaceans, and small fish. Axolotls are unusual among amphibians in that they reach adulthood without going through metamorphosis.</p>
<p>The axolotl are facing extinction and are considered a critically endangered species. The urbanization of Mexico City has caused water pollution in Lake Xochimilco causing a decline in the population of the axolotl. This is a critical issue because the axolotl is only found in Lake Xochimilco and the urbanization of Mexico City is causing their only habitat to become polluted. Axolotl is also considered a delicacy in Mexican markets and was sold as food as well as being a staple food in Aztec diets. The pollution of Lake Xochimilco and being considered as a delicacy has caused the axolotl to considered an endangered species. </p>
